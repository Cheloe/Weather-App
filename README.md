# Weather-App


## Here's what I did: 

<li> Outlined html
<li> Defined OpenWeather api search queries
<li> Since the weather api requires lat/long coordinates, and I want users to be able to search by city name, I wrote a function to retrieve the lat/long coordinates of a given city from OpenWeather's coordinate finder api
<li> Created function to enter those coords into a forecast query and extract from the response the forecast elements I want to display to users
